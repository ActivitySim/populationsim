Introduction
=============

PopulationSim is an open platform for population synthesis.  It emerged from Oregon DOT's desire to 
build a shared, open, platform that could be easily adapted for statewide, regional, and urban 
transportation planning needs.
      
What is population synthesis?
-----------------------------
Activity Based Models (ABMs) operate in a micro-simulation framework , wherein the travel choices of person and household decision-making agents are predicted by applying Monte Carlo methods to behavioral models. This requires a data set of households and persons representing the entire population in the modeling region. Population synthesis refers to the process used to create this data.

The required inputs to population synthesis are a population sample and marginal distributions. The population 
sample is commonly referred to as the *seed or reference sample* and the marginal distributions are referred to 
as *controls or targets*. **The process of expanding the seed sample to match the marginal distribution 
is termed population synthesis.** The software tool which implements this population synthesis process 
is termed as a **Population Synthesizer**.

What does a Population Synthesizer produce?
-------------------------------------------
The objective of a population synthesizer is to generate a synthetic population for 
a modeling region. The main outputs from a population synthesizer include lists of persons and households 
representing the entire population of the modeling region. These databases include household and person-level 
attributes of interest. Examples of attributes at the household level include household income, household size, housing type, and number of vehicles. Examples of person attributes include  
age, gender, work\school status, and occupation. Depending on the use case, a population synthesizer may also 
produce multi-way distribution of demographic variables at different geographies to be used as an input 
to aggregate travel models. In the case of PopulationSim specifically, an additional option is also included to 
modify an existing regional synthetic population for a smaller geographical area. In this case, the outputs are a modified list of persons and households.

How does a population synthesizer work?
---------------------------------------
The main inputs to a population synthesizer are disaggregate population samples and marginal control
distributions. In the United States, the disaggregate population sample is typically obtained from the Census Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), but other sources, such as a household travel survey, can also be used. The seed sample should 
include demographic variables corresponding to each marginal control termed as *controlled variables* (e.g., 
household size, household income, etc.). The seed sample could also include other variables of interest but not 
necessarily controlled via marginal controls. These are termed as *uncontrolled variables*. The seed sample should also include an initial weight on each household record. 

Base-year marginal distributions of person and household-level attributes of interest are available from Census. For future years, marginal distributions are either held constant, or forecasted.  Marginal distributions can be for both household or person level variables and are specified at a specific geography (e.g., Block Groups, Traffic Analysis Zone or County). PopulationSim allows controls to be specified at multiple geographic levels. 

The objective of a population synthesizer is to 
generate household weights which satisfies the marginal control distributions. This is achieved by use of 
a data fitting technique. The most common fitting technique used by various population synthesizers is the 
Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure. Generally, the IPF procedure is used to obtain joint distributions of demographic 
variables. Then, random sampling from PUMS generates the baseline synthetic population. 

One of the limitations of the simple IPF method is that it does not incorporate both household and person 
level attributes simulatenously. Some population synthesizers use a heuristic algorithm called the 
Iterative Proportional Updating Algorithm (IPU) to incorporate both person and household-level variables in the fitting procedure. 

Besides IPF, entropy 
maximization algorithms have been used as a fitting technique. In most of the entropy based methods, 
the relative entropy is used as the objective function. The relative entropy based optimization ensures 
that the least amount of new information is introduced in finding a feasible solution. The base entropy 
is defined by the initial weights in the seed sample. The weights generated by the entropy maximization 
algorithm preserves the distribution of initial weights while matching the marginal controls. This is an 
advantage of the entropy maximization based procedures over the IPF based procedures. 

Once the final weights 
have been assigned, seed sample is expanded using these weights to generate a synthetic population. Most 
population synthesizers create distributions using final weights and employ random sampling to expand the
seed sample. PopulationSim uses Linear Programming to convert the final weights to integer values and expands 
the seed sample using these integer weights.
