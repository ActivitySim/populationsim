Introduction
=============

PopulationSim is an open platform for population synthesis.  It emerged from Oregon DOT's desire to 
build a shared, open, platform that could be easily adapted for statewide, regional, and urban 
transportation planning needs.
      
What is population synthesis?
-----------------------------
Activity Based Models (ABMs) operate in a micro-simulation framework , wherein the travel and activity 
choices of person and household decision-making agents are predicted by applying Monte Carlo methods to 
behavioral models. This requires person and household level attributes of the entire population 
in the modeling region. Moreover, designing a forecasting scenario requires a process to synthesize 
a population fitting the scenarioâ€™s demographic assumptions.

The available inputs are a population sample and marginal distributions. This population sample is 
commonly referred to as the *seed or reference sample* and the marginal distributions are referred to 
as *controls or targets*. **The process of expanding the seed sample to match the marginal distribution 
is termed population synthesis.** The software tool which implements this populations synthesis process 
is termed as a **Population Synthesizer**.

What does a Population Synthesizer produce?
-------------------------------------------
The objective of a population synthesizer is to generate synthetic population for 
a modeling region. The main outputs from a population synthesizer include lists of persons and households 
representing the entire population of the modeling region. These databases include household and person-level 
attributes of interest. For example, household income, household size, housing type, number of vehicles, 
person age, person occupation, etc. Depending on the use case, a population synthesizer may also 
produce multi-way distribution of demographic variables at different geographies to be used as an input 
to aggregate travel models. Advanced population synthesizers such as PopulationSim includes option to 
modify an existing synthetic population for a smaller geography. In this case, the outputs would 
be a modified list of persons and households.

How does a population synthesizer work?
---------------------------------------
The main inputs to a population synthesizer are disaggregate population samples and marginal control
distributions. Disaggregate population samples can be obtained from sources like American Community 
Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) or a household travel survey. Marginal distributions of 
person and household-level attributes of interest are also available from Census. The seed sample should 
include demographic variables corresponding to each marginal control termed as *controlled variables* (e.g., 
household size, household income, etc.). Seed sample should also include other variables of interest but not 
necessarily controlled via marginal controls. These are termed as *uncontrolled variables*. Marginal 
distributions can be for both household or person level variables and are specified at a specific 
geography (e.g., Block Groups, Traffic Analysis Zone or County). Traditionally, all population synthesizers
required all controls to be specified at the same geographic level. More advanced population synthesizers 
(PopulationSim, PopSynIII, PopGen2) allow controls specification at multiple geographic levels. Seed sample 
also includes an initial weight on each household record. The objective of a population synthesizer is to 
generate household weights which satisfies the marginal control distributions. This is achieved by use of 
a data fitting technique. 

The most common fitting technique used by various population synthesizers is the Iterative Proportional 
Fitting (IPF) procedure. Generally, the IPF procedure is used to obtain joint distributions of demographic 
variables and random sampling from PUMS to generate baseline synthetic population. One of the limitations 
of the IPF method is that it does not incorporate person level attributes while generating the joint 
distributions. PopGen uses a heuristic algorithm called the Iterative Proportional Updating Algorithm (IPU) 
to incorporate both person and household-level variables in the fitting procedure. Besides IPF, entropy 
maximization algorithms have been used as a fitting technique. In most of the entropy based methods, 
the relative entropy is used as the objective function. The relative entropy based optimization ensures 
that the least amount of new information is introduced in finding a feasible solution. The base entropy 
is defined by the initial weights in the seed sample. The weights generated by the entropy maximization 
algorithm preserves the distribution of initial weights while matching the marginal controls. This is an 
advantage of the entropy maximization based procedures over the IPF based procedures. Once the final weights 
have been assigned, seed sample is expanded using these weights to generate a synthetic population. Most 
population synthesizers create distributions using final weights and employ random sampling to expand the
seed sample. PopulationSim use Linear Programming to convert the final weights to integer values and expands 
the seed sample using these integer weights.
