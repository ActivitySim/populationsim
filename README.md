PopulationSim is an open platform for population synthesis.  It emerged
from Oregon DOT's desire to build a shared, open, platform that could be
easily adapted for statewide, regional, and urban transportation planning
needs.  PopulationSim is implemented in the
[ActivitySim](https://github.com/activitysim/activitysim) framework.
