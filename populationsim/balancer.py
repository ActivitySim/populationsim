    Single-geography list balancer using Newton-Raphson method with control relaxation.

    Takes a list of households with initial weights assigned to each household, and updates those
    weights in such a way as to match the marginal distribution of control variables while
    minimizing the change to the initial weights. Uses Newton-Raphson method with control
    relaxation.

    The resulting weights are float weights, so need to be integerized to integer household weights
