    """
    Balance the household weights for each of the seed geographies (independently)
    using the seed level controls and the aggregated sub-zone controls totals.

    Create the seed_weights table with one row per household and columns contaiing
    household_id, seed geography (e.g. PUMA), and float preliminary_balanced_weights

    Adds seed_weights table to pipeline named <seed_geography>_weights (e.g. PUMA_weights):

    | index  | PUMA | preliminary_balanced_weight | hh_id |
